                "c": "Torsion is defined as the twisting of a specimen caused by a certain amount of torque. Compressive forces are forces that are applied to an object that results in the specimen getting compacted."

                "a": "The product of modulus of rigidity (C) and polar moment of inertia (J) is called torsional rigidity. Torsional rigidity is a torque that produces a twist of one radian in a shaft of unit length."
