 A shaft fixed at one end and twisted at the other end due to the action of torque T. The radius of shaft is R and the length is L.
Imagine a horizontal radial line drawn on the end face. When the end is twisted, the line rotates through an angle θ.
G is one of the elastic constants of the material. The equation is only true so long as the material remains elastic.
<br>


T/J = Gϴ/L <br>

Where <br>
T = Torque applied <br>
J = polar moment of inertia of the shaft = πd4/32 <br>
C = rigidity modulus of the material <br>
ϴ = relative angle of twist in radians <br>
L = gauge length (length of the shaft over which the relative angle of twist is measured) <br>
